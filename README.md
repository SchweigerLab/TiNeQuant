TiNeQuant is an image processing pipeline used for the quantification of network density in 3D image stacks. 
It is based on the Fiji platform, written as imageJ macro and published under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

TiNeQuant features six different versions depending on your input data.

---Single_channel_open.ijm is a ImageJ macro (IJM) script that quantifies 3D network structures in single channel image stacks that are currently open in Fiji. You choose LABKIT classifiers used for image segmentation after running the script via its implemented user interface.

---Single_channel_in_directory_lif.ijm is a ImageJ macro (IJM) script that quantifies 3D network structures in single channel image stacks safed as .TIF files. You choose the directory used for network quantification as well as the LABKIT classifiers used for image segmentation after running the script via its implemented user interface. 

---Single_channel_in_batch_lif.ijm is a ImageJ macro (IJM) script that quantifies 3D network structures in single channel image stacks safed in a .LIF file. You choose the .lif file containing the image stacks used for network quantification as well as the LABKIT classifiers used for image segmentation after running the script via its implemented user interface. 

---Two_channel_open.ijm is a ImageJ macro (IJM) script that quantifies 3D network structures in two channel image stacks that are currently open in Fiji. You choose LABKIT classifiers used for image segmentation after running the script via its implemented user interface.

---Two_channel_in_directory_lif.ijm is a ImageJ macro (IJM) script that quantifies 3D network structures in two channel image stacks safed as .TIF files. You choose the directory used for network quantification as well as the LABKIT classifiers used for image segmentation after running the script via its implemented user interface. 

---Two_channel_in_batch_lif.ijm is a ImageJ macro (IJM) script that quantifies 3D network structures in two channel image stacks safed in a .LIF file. You choose the .lif file containing the image stacks used for network quantification as well as the LABKIT classifiers used for image segmentation after running the script via its implemented user interface.
